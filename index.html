    <h2> About Maggie </h2>

    <p>Maggie Porterfield is Southern Belle living in New York City. She took quite a long journey spanning three coasts to get where she is today. That journey started near the Gulf Coast in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was born, grew up and went to college. Days after graduation, she packed up her car and drove to the Bay Area in sunny California. When she realized the Bay Area was actually not sunny at all, she quickly made the move to Los Angeles. Seven years of sunny days later, she was ready to make the move to NYC she had always dreamed of.</p>

    <p>Today you can find Maggie managing a website for a fashion designer on Fifth Avenue. Maggie also has a love for all things vintage, and is currently working on launching her own vintage online store. She's taking an awesome coding class to help her make this happen! On the weekends, you can find her riding her bike, frequenting the farmers market, and scouring estate sales. She is the proud mother of two feline children.</p>
